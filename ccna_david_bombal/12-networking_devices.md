# Some networking devices - Repeaters, Hubs, Switches and Routers

## Repeaters:

A repeater is an electronic device that recieves a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be recieved on the other side of an obstruction.

## Notes:

- A hub is simply a multi-port repeater.
- A wireless network is essentially still a hub in the air.
- Bridge is something between hub and router. They learn the MAC address in the network but as a software.
- It then rebranded to switch cause they can learn MAC address as in hardware present the network.
- Switches learn MAC address much more quickly by using ASICs(Application Specific Integrated Circuits).
- repeater -> hub -> bridge -> switch
- We can also say that routers route from one physical medium to another(other than ip network) like from ethernet to serial ports, from physical ethernet to wireless etc or can also sometimes say that from LAN to WAN
- Switches nowadays also have routing functionality, so they are also called layer3 Switches. Typically, it's routing from one VLAN to another VLAN(routing between different subnet).
